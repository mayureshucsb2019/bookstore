Question:

"How can you develop a set of RESTful APIs in Golang to manage an online bookstore, including features for managing books, authors, customers, and orders? Containerize the entire application using Docker, and deploy it locally so that these APIs can be queried and tested using Postman."

This question involves the following:

API Development:

Books API: Endpoints for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting books.
Authors API: Endpoints for managing author information.
Customers API: Endpoints for managing customer data.
Orders API: Endpoints for creating and managing customer orders, including the association between books and customers.
Data Relationships:

Implement relationships between the data models (e.g., books have authors, orders have customers and books).
Dockerization:

Create a Dockerfile to containerize the Golang application.
Use Docker Compose if multiple containers (e.g., for a database and the Go application) are needed.
Build and run Docker containers locally.
Testing with Postman:

Use Postman to query the deployed APIs.
Test all CRUD operations across different entities (books, authors, customers, orders).
Ensure proper handling of relationships and data consistency across different entities.
This project provides a hands-on experience with multiple interconnected APIs, involving various aspects of web development, database management, Dockerization, and testing.
